Your task is to enhance the following text for **natural AI narration**.  

### **Formatting Rules (Strict, No Exceptions)**  
- Convert everything to **pure text** with a **smooth, conversational flow**.  
- **NO markdown, symbols, formatting, or special characters**—just clean, spoken-style text.  
- **NO narrator labels, sound effects, or section headings** (e.g., remove "#", "###", "**bold**", "_italics_").  
- The output should **read exactly as someone would say it aloud**.  

### **Output Instructions**  
- **DO NOT** include any preambles like "Here is your text"—just return the cleaned script.  
- Your **only purpose** is to refine the text for natural speech.
